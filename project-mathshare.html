        <h1>Mathshare: Making Math Accessible, Step by Step</h1>
        
        <h2>Project Context</h2>
        <p>
        Math is a gateway to opportunity-but for millions of students with disabilities, traditional math tools and digital content are barriers rather than bridges. At Benetech, I led UX research for Mathshare: an inclusive, step-by-step math problem-solving platform designed to empower all learners, especially those with learning disabilities, dyslexia, and low vision.
        <p>Mathshare enables students to break down math problems, show their work, and explain their reasoning in a way that’s accessible to teachers and compatible with assistive technologies. Our mission: make math not just accessible, but understandable and confidence-building for every student.
        
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        As the lead UX Researcher, I:

        <ul>
          <li>Drove user research from discovery to validation, collaborating with product, engineering, and education teams

          <li>Conducted interviews, usability studies, and classroom pilots with students and teachers

          <li>Synthesized feedback into actionable design recommendations

          <li>Advocated for accessibility and inclusive design at every stage
        </ul>

        <h2>Research Approach</h2>
        <p>
        To ensure Mathshare truly met the needs of diverse learners, I used a multi-pronged, participatory research strategy:
        <ul>
          <li>Stakeholder Interviews: Engaged students with disabilities, special education teachers, and assistive technology coordinators to surface pain points and aspirations.

          <li>Classroom Pilots: Observed Mathshare in real K-12 settings, gathering feedback on usability, accessibility, and learning outcomes.

          <li>Iterative Usability Testing: Ran remote and in-person sessions to test new features, focusing on keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and cognitive load.

          <li>Surveys & Analytics: Collected quantitative data on engagement, task completion, and satisfaction to complement qualitative insights.
        </ul>



        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Step-by-Step Problem Solving: Students benefited from breaking problems into discrete steps, which reduced overwhelm and supported executive function.

          <li>Show Your Work: The ability to annotate reasoning helped teachers understand student thinking and provided scaffolding for learners who struggled with traditional formats.

          <li>Accessibility Gaps: Many math tools failed to support screen readers, keyboard navigation, or alternative input methods, creating barriers for students with visual impairments or motor disabilities.

          <li>Teacher Workflows: Teachers needed simple ways to assign problems, review student work, and provide feedback-all while managing diverse classroom needs.
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Impact & Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
        Based on these findings, we delivered:
        <ul>
          <li>An Intuitive, Accessible Editor: Built on top of MathLive, Mathshare’s editor supports keyboard navigation, screen readers, and step-by-step input.

          <li>Seamless Teacher Integration: Teachers can assign, review, and give feedback on student work, streamlining classroom workflows.

          <li>Open Source & Free: Mathshare is free for schools and integrates with learning management systems, expanding reach and equity.

          <li>Born Accessible: Every feature was designed to meet or exceed accessibility standards, ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies.
        </ul>
