        <h1>Telepresence for Accessible Museums: Improving Self-Efficacy of Visitors with Developmental Disabilities</h1>
        
        <h2>Project Context</h2>
        <p>Museums are pillars of public education and cultural engagement, but many visitors with developmental disabilities face barriers to fully participating in these experiences. For example, cognitive barriers to using public transit and buying admission tickets, and mobility barriers to leaving the house and accessing public spaces.
        
        <p>Our project explored how telepresence robots (remotely operated devices equipped with cameras, microphones, and screens) could expand access and agency for these visitors, allowing them to explore museum spaces from afar and interact with exhibits and staff in real time.

        <p>This work was presented at the ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS 2018) and is detailed in the publication, "Using a Telepresence Robot to Improve Self-Efficacy of People with Developmental Disabilities" (Friedman & Cabral, 2018).

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        As the co-lead researcher, I:

        <ul>
          <li>Co-designed the study and research protocol

          <li>Facilitated user sessions with participants with developmental disabilities

          <li>Conducted qualitative interviews and survey responses before and after the sessions.

          <li>Synthesized findings, conducted the analysis, and co-authored the final publication
        </ul>


        <h2>Research Approach</h2>
        <p>Our goal was twofold. First, to determine whether telepresence is a viable option for individuals with developmental disabilities to overcome challenges in participating in public exploratory spaces. Second, to investigate how the use of telepresence robots impacts participants' physical and social self-efficacy and wellbeing.

        <p>Pilot Sessions: Participants remotely navigated a telepresence robot through a museum, controlling its movement and interacting with staff.

        <p></p>Observations: We recorded and analyzed user behaviors, noting moments of engagement, confusion, and autonomy.

        <p></p>Pre/Post Interviews: We assessed changes in participantsâ€™ self-efficacy and confidence before and after their telepresence experience.

        <p></p>Thematic Analysis: Qualitative data was coded to identify patterns in user experience, accessibility barriers, and empowerment.

        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased Engagement: Participants reported feeling more engaged and present in the museum experience, with many expressing excitement about exploring new exhibits.

          <li>Improved Self-Efficacy: Participants demonstrated increased confidence in their ability to navigate the museum and interact with staff, as evidenced by pre/post survey results.

          <li>Social Connection: Real-time audio and video enabled meaningful interactions with museum staff, making the experience feel personal and engaging.

          <li>Usability Challenges: Some participants initially struggled with navigation controls and required brief orientation and support.

          <li>Environmental Barriers: Physical obstacles in the museum (e.g., narrow passages, crowds) sometimes limited robot mobility, highlighting the need for accessible exhibit design.
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Impact & Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Our study demonstrated that telepresence robots can meaningfully increase access, engagement, and self-efficacy for visitors with developmental disabilities in museum settings. 
        <ul>
          <li>Effective <b>accessibility tool</b> for individuals with developmental disabilties 
          <li>Corroborates <b>prior research</b> that telepresence robots can increase feelings of engagement
          <li>Benefits and provides a basis of research for a <b>wider population</b> who face mobility impairments or who have difficulty accessing public spaces 
        </ul>
