      <p>
        I am a UX Researcher on the Cloud Native Experiences team for Microsoft Azure, currently specializing in Linux and Open Source projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise is in accessibility, and I previously led research for new projects on Benetech's Labs team, a nonprofit focused on bridging 
        the gap between people and technologies. Most known for Bookshare, the world's largest library of ebooks for people with
        reading disabilities, Benetech works to bridge the gap between people and technology.
        <p>I was previously active in / am currently involved in the DIAGRAM Center.</p>
      </p>
      <p> 
        I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) in 2018 in Cogntive Science, with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
        <p> 
          I was a member of the ASSIST Lab, the Re-Embodied Cognition lab, and the Cognitive Modelling Lab. I was mentored by Leila Takayama and Sri Kurniawan.
        </p>
        <p>I received first place in ASSETS ACM Student Research Competition and am published in the 2018 journal proceedings for my work on using telepresence robots to improve museum access for people with developmental disabilities.</p>
