        <h1>Executable Docs: Making Developer Documentation Interactive and Intuitive</h1>
        <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
        
        <p> At Microsoft Azure, one of the key factors that influence the adoption of cloud services is the <b>ease and speed of deployment</b>. Customers who can quickly set up and run applications or Proofs-of Concept on the cloud are <b>more likely to convert</b>. Therefore, it is important to support quick, successful deployments for new users to Azure, especially for connected resources that require complex configuration and integration. 
          
        <p> The challenge was to design a seamless, intuitive experience that integrates live code execution without overwhelming users or disrupting their workflow.

        <h2> My Role</h2>
        As the UX Researcher on this project, I partnered closely with product managers, engineers, and designers to deeply understand how developers consume documentation and interact with Linux deployment stacks. My responsibility was to uncover user needs, identify pain points, and validate design decisions through rigorous research.

        <h2>Research Approach</h2>
        To capture a comprehensive picture of developer behavior and needs, I employed a multi-method research strategy:

        <ul> 
          <li><u>Semi-Structured Interviews</u>: Conducted in-depth interviews with Azure, AWS, and GCP developers and DevOps engineers to explore current learning and onboarding habits and frustrations.

          <li><u>Usability Testing:</u> Facilitated remote sessions where participants used early designs and interactive prototypes of Executable Docs, focusing on code execution, script <b>personalization</b>, and <b>navigation of steps</b>.
    
          <li><u>Analytics:</u> Gathered quantitative data on feature usage and conversion to complement qualitative insights.


        </ul>

        <h2> Key Insights</h2>
        <p>Participants overwhelmingly preferred <u>guided deployment</u> during the study. Participants saw it as a way to <b>sanity check</b> their deployments, and wanted to <b>understand</b> exactly what the script was going to do.
        
        <p>The visibility of the scripts, guided explanations, and table of contents overview were perceived as a <b>positive change</b> from the current portal and command line experiences. 

        <p>Participants strongly expressed the need for more <b>customization</b> of the enviornment variables and scripts, particularly to mitigate concerns over <b>cost and security</b>.

        <h2>Solutions & Impact</h2>
        Based on these insights, we iterated on the design to:

        <ul>
          <li>Implement a <u>guided deployment</u> experience with clear explanations of each step and the ability to execute code snippets directly within the documentation.

          <li>Provide a <u>customizable script editor</u> that allows users to modify environment variables and scripts before execution.

          <li>Enhance the <u>navigation experience</u> with a table of contents overview and dynamic updating of current status, enabling users to quickly access relevant sections and code snippets.

          <li>Integrate <u>dynamic visual indicators</u> for code execution states (running, success, failure).

        </ul>
        <p>Post-launch metrics showed a significant increase in Linux deployments and user engagement with executable docs. Feedback from follow up usability studies highlighted improved confidence and efficiency when using Executable Docs.
        <p>Overall, the Executable Docs project successfully transformed developer documentation into an interactive, user-friendly experience that empowers users to understand and deploy applications quickly and confidently on Azure.</p>
